 *Garbage collector is best example of Daemon thread as it is always running in background.
 *Main objective of Garbage Collector is to free heap memory by destroying unreachable objects.
 *
 *Unreachable objects : An object is said to be unreachable iff it doesnâ€™t contain any reference to it. 
 *Also note that objects which are part of island of isolation are also unreachable.
 *
 *Eligibility for garbage collection : An object is said to be eligible for GC(garbage collection) iff it is unreachable.  
 *after i = null; 
 *integer object 4 in heap area is eligible for garbage collection.
 *
 *Even though programmer is not responsible to destroy useless objects but it is highly recommended to make an object unreachable(thus eligible for GC) if it is no longer required.
There are generally four different ways to make an object eligible for garbage collection.
Nullifying the reference variable
Re-assigning the reference variable
Object created inside method
Island of Isolation
